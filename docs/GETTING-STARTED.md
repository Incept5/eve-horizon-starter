# Getting Started with Eve Horizon

> Clone, load skills, let AI configure everything

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Clone the Template

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Incept5/eve-horizon-starter my-project
cd my-project
```

### 2. Install Eve Skills

The template includes Eve skills for Claude Code and other AI coding agents:

```bash
# Install the skills
./bin/install-skills.sh

# Or manually:
cd eve-skillpacks && ./install.sh
```

### 3. Start Your AI Coding Agent

Open the project in your AI coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.):

```bash
claude  # or your preferred agent
```

### 4. Run the Setup Skill

Simply ask your AI agent:

> "Run the eve-new-project-setup skill"

The AI will:
- Install the Eve CLI if needed
- Set up your staging profile and authentication
- Interview you about your project
- Configure the Eve manifest
- Help you set up your own Git remote

That's it! Your project is ready.

## What Just Happened?

The setup skill automated:

1. **CLI Installation**: `npm install -g @eve/cli`
2. **Profile Creation**: `eve profile create staging --api-url https://api.eve-staging.incept5.dev`
3. **Authentication**: Using your SSH key (auto-discovered from GitHub if needed)
4. **Manifest Configuration**: Set project slug, name, description in `.eve/manifest.yaml`
5. **Git Setup**: Changed remote from template to your own repo

## What Can Eve Horizon Do?

Eve Horizon runs AI-powered jobs for your project:

| Category | Examples |

| **Development** | Code scaffolding, refactoring, migrations |

## Next Steps

After setup, try these:

```bash

# Create your first job
eve jobs create --prompt "Review the codebase and suggest improvements"

# Check job status
eve jobs list
```

## Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to set up manually or need to troubleshoot, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- **SSH key** (ed25519 or RSA) - typically at `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
- **GitHub account** with your SSH key added (for auto-discovery)
- **Node.js 18+** installed
- **API URL** from your admin (e.g., `https://api.eve-staging.incept5.dev`)

### Install the CLI

```bash
# Using npm
npm install -g @eve/cli

# Using pnpm
pnpm add -g @eve/cli

# Verify installation
eve --help
```

If you're working from source:

```bash
cd packages/cli
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm link --global
```

### Create a Profile

```bash
eve profile create staging --api-url https://api.eve-staging.incept5.dev
```

### Set Default Credentials

```bash
eve profile set --default-email you@example.com --default-ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

### Log In

```bash
eve auth login
```

If your SSH key isn't registered, the CLI will offer to fetch your keys from GitHub:

```
No registered SSH key found for this user.
Enter GitHub username to register keys (or press Enter to skip): your-github-username

Found 2 SSH key(s) for github.com/your-github-username
Register them? [Y/n]: y
Registered 2 SSH key(s)

Retrying login with registered keys...
Logged in
```

### Configure the Manifest

Edit `.eve/manifest.yaml` with your project details:

```yaml
component:
  kind: app
  slug: my-project
  name: My Project
  description: A brief description of your project
```

### Set Up Your Git Remote

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YourOrg/my-project.git
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No registered SSH key found"

Your SSH key isn't registered with Eve. Options:

1. **Auto-register from GitHub**: During login, enter your GitHub username when prompted
2. **Contact your admin**: Ask them to register your key using `eve admin invite`

### "Challenge expired"

SSH challenges are valid for 5 minutes. Request a new one:

```bash
eve auth login
```

### "Not authenticated"

Your token may have expired. Log in again:

```bash
eve auth logout
eve auth login
```

### Job Stuck in "ready"

The job is waiting to be scheduled. Check:

1. Is the orchestrator running? `eve system health`
2. Are there available workers? `eve system status`

### Job Failed

View the logs and diagnostics:

```bash
eve job logs MyProj-abc123
eve job diagnose MyProj-abc123
```

### Wrong Profile Active

Switch profiles:

```bash
eve profile use staging
```

### API Connection Refused

Verify the API URL is correct:

```bash
eve profile show
eve system health
```
