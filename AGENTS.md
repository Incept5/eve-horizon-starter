# Eve Horizon Starter - Agent Instructions

This is an Eve-compatible starter project. Agents working in this repo should follow these guidelines.

## CRITICAL: Load Eve Docs Skill First

Before doing any work, load the **eve-read-eve-docs** skill. It is the public, distilled source of Eve Horizon system docs (CLI, manifest, pipelines, jobs, secrets) and is required when private docs are unavailable.

```bash
openskills read eve-read-eve-docs
```


## Default Environment (Staging)

Default to **staging** for usage guidance and deployments. Use local/docker only when explicitly asked to do local development.

Set the API URL for all CLI commands:

```bash
export EVE_API_URL=https://api.eh1.incept5.dev
```

## Project Overview

- **Purpose**: Minimal starter template for Eve-compatible projects
- **Stack**: Staging-first Eve Horizon with Docker Compose for local dev
- **Skills**: eve-se skillpack installed via `eve init` or `eve skills install`

Local dev runs via Docker Compose and is then translated into `.eve/manifest.yaml` for deployment to the remote staging cluster.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.eve/manifest.yaml` | Deployment configuration (services, envs) |
| `skills.txt` | Skill sources for agents |
| `.eve/hooks/on-clone.sh` | Auto-installs skills when Eve workers clone |
| `apps/api/` | Example API service |
| `scripts/` | Helper scripts for setup and deploy |

## Common Tasks

### Local dev (Docker Compose)
```bash
docker compose up --build   # http://localhost:3000
```

### Deploy to environments

**Via pipeline** (recommended for CI/CD):
```bash
eve pipeline run deploy --env staging
```

**Direct deployment** (requires explicit git ref):
```bash
# Deploy to test environment with git SHA or branch
eve env deploy test --ref abc123
eve env deploy test --ref main

# Deploy to staging with git SHA or branch
eve env deploy staging --ref abc123
eve env deploy staging --ref main
```

**Note**: The `--ref` parameter is required and must be a valid git SHA or branch name.

### Inspect builds
```bash
eve build list                    # List builds for current project
eve build show <build_id>         # Build spec details
eve build artifacts <build_id>    # Image digests produced
eve build diagnose <build_id>     # Full diagnostic (spec + runs + artifacts + logs)
eve build logs <build_id>         # Build output logs
```

### Promotion flow (test → staging)
```bash
# 1. Build and deploy to test
eve env deploy test --ref abc123

# 2. Get release information
eve release resolve v1.2.3

# 3. Promote to staging with release reference
eve env deploy staging --ref abc123 --inputs '{"release_id":"rel_xxx"}'
```

### Check deployment
```bash
eve env status staging
```

### Add a new service
1. Add Dockerfile in `apps/<name>/`
2. Add service to `.eve/manifest.yaml`
3. Deploy: `eve env deploy staging --ref main` or `eve pipeline run deploy --env staging`

## Skills Available

Skills are installed automatically by `eve init`. Key skills:
- **eve-new-project-setup** - Initial profile/auth/manifest configuration
- **eve-manifest-authoring** - Manifest editing guidance
- **eve-deploy-debugging** - Troubleshoot deployments
- **eve-pipelines-workflows** - CI/CD configuration
- **eve-job-lifecycle** - Create and manage Eve jobs

Run `openskills list` to see all installed skills.

## Development Workflow

1. Make changes to code
2. Test locally: `docker compose up --build`
3. Deploy: `eve env deploy staging --ref main` (or use `eve pipeline run deploy --env staging`)
4. Verify: `eve env status staging`

## Keep AGENTS.md Current (Critical)

This file must be rewritten to match the actual product domain and tech stack once the user decides what they are building. The starter API/UI is disposable: expect to replace or remove it entirely. When the real project direction is chosen, document:

- The domain and core product goals.
- The chosen stack and architecture.
- What starter code was removed or replaced, and what (if anything) was kept.
- The new local dev and deploy workflow.

## Available Skills

<!-- SKILLS_TABLE_START -->
<usage>
When users ask you to perform tasks, check if any of the available skills below can help complete the task more effectively. Skills provide specialized capabilities and domain knowledge.

How to use skills:
- Invoke: Bash("openskills read <skill-name>")
- The skill content will load with detailed instructions on how to complete the task
- Base directory provided in output for resolving bundled resources (references/, scripts/, assets/)

Usage notes:
- Only use skills listed in <available_skills> below
- Do not invoke a skill that is already loaded in your context
- Each skill invocation is stateless
