CRITICAL: READ AGENTS.md FIRST

This repo is a starter. `AGENTS.md` is the source of truth for how to work here and must be updated to match the real product, domain, and stack you choose.

Agent runtime configuration lives in `agents/` and should be synced after edits:

```bash
eve agents sync --project proj_xxx --ref main --repo-dir .
```
